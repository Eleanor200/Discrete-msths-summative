How Discrete mathematics is relevant to the project.
For us to be able to correctly write a code to work, we have to first understand what graphs and the different types of graphs exist. In discrete mathematics, we are able to understand this.
Discrete mathematics is relevant because:
It helps us understand the definition of graphs which is any collection of vertices and edges.
It helped us understand the different types of graphs that exist and the difference between them.
In the project we were asked to identify if our graph has Euler circuits or not, to do this, using the knowledge of Discrete mathematics, we have to check the conditions for a graph to have an Euler circuit is fulfilled.
In our code, we need


how to find the probability that Probability (G(4, 1/2) is connected)=?
Any graph with less than two edges is disconnected, while any graph with at least four edges is connected (since there are only 3 edges among any 3 of the vertices). As a result, you can conduct the majority of the work simply by summing probabilities for the number of edges without having to deal with individual configurations. Then all you have to do is analyze which three-edge combinations link the graph and count them.
"""Determining the probability"""

"""
To determine the probability of a given graph to be Eulerian, the following conditions must be met:
   1. The graph must have even node degrees. The probability that the nodes have an even node degree is 1/2.
   2. The graph must be connected. The probability the graph is connected is 1/2. W can therefore calculate
   the probability of the given graph is we know the probability of it being connected.

So, the probability that any given graph has an Eulerian circuit is given by the above conditions.
       P(Euler) = P(even node degree) * P(graph is connected)
                = 1/2 * 1/2
                = 0.25 or 25%
